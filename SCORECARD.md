# audio scorecard — mint

Owned axes: depth, coverage, calibration. Scores remain unassigned without a
quality rubric; a row count is a measurement, not a score or verdict.

| axis | score | evidence / counting command | last change |
|---|---|---|---|
| depth | unmeasured | mint: no rounds yet | mint |
| coverage | unmeasured | mint: no rounds yet | mint |
| calibration | unmeasured | mint: no rounds yet | mint |

planned: round 1 declares the first falsifiable claim (see LOG.md).
retired: none.

## Round 1 verdict — 2026-10-12

| axis | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| depth | improved | source-generated SFX/stem plus format, RMS/peak, EBU gated loudness, FFT centroid/bandwidth and loop endpoint checks; `corpus/fixtures/` + `corpus/knowledge/2026-10-12-fixture-battery.md` |
| coverage | improved | four SFX and one stem with passing normal receipt and failing seam positive control; `.shokunin/reports/audio-r1-verifier.md` |
| calibration | improved | calibrated thresholds are labeled local; short-SFX gated LUFS is null, RMS remains available; seam/centroid proxies explicitly do not establish perceptual quality; verifier report |

Admission: at least one improved, none harmed. Score remains unassigned; no scalar rating is implied. SHONEN box 1 was checked by the named non-author verifier only. Other boxes remain open.

## Round 2 verdict — 2026-10-12

| axis | verdict | before → after evidence |
|---|---|---|
| depth | unchanged | Same generated-WAV duration/format, level, full-signal spectrum, ebur128 and endpoint battery applies to nine files; no new quality dimension claimed. `reports/round-2/r2-adjudicator.md` |
| coverage | improved | Four → eight SFX (one → two in each UI/impact/movement/ambience category), unchanged stem. Count: `python3 -c "from pathlib import Path; print(sorted(p.stem for p in Path('.shokunin/audio/corpus/artifacts').glob('*.wav')))"`; all nine measured and four variant distinctness rules pass in `corpus/live/runs/20261012T161825061249Z-normal/measurements.json`. Before `31d8e9e`; measured on round-2 delivered files, see `reports/round-2/r2-verifier.md`. |
| calibration | improved narrowly | Ambiguous nonzero-duration branch tightened before integration to >=.020 s; measured centroid OR branch remains >=.10, receipt includes both. All are fixture-local thresholds, not mastering/perceptual rules. `reports/round-2/r2-critic.md`, `r2-adjudicator.md`. |

Admission: coverage improved, calibration narrowly improved, depth unchanged, none harmed. No scalar score assigned. Named non-author `r2-verifier` checked SHONEN box 2; 3–4 open.
